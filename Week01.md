## Intros: 15 min
Who are you, who are we

## Syllabus Review: 15 min
How is the semester going to proceed.

## Your Projects: 20 min
I want to hear, in 140 chars or less, what your pitch was last semester. So take five minutes to refine a description of what you are proposing to build, and we'll do a lightning round. If you really hate your pitch, you have five minutes to think of something you wish you'd pitched. No commitments, I just want to see where you all are coming from.

When we're done, if you already know that you're pitching, let's get those on the table.

Write down the projects you're interested in working on.

## Project Roles: 20-30 min
We're going to work in teams of four. Each team should have one person responsible for...

+ Project Manager
+ Programmer/Developer
+ Design/UX
+ Outreach and Engagement

## Milestones: 20-30 min
One of the first things you're going to need to do is develop a project plan, so lets look at the kids of things, by category, that we're looking for as milestones.

### Software development lifecycle
We're not going to get deep into philosophies of software development, but if you want to look at [agile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) and [scrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29) methodologies ... we might. We'll see.

> Assess -> Design -> Build -> Test ->  Deploy -> Evaluate -> Design...

Our goal is to get you to a good working *prototype* by the end of the semester. That means we need to deploy and test *something* halfway through the semester.
