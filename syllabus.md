Digital  Praxis  Seminar, Spring 2015
MALS 75500/IDS  81640

##Overview
Aiming to ensure that new students begin thinking about digital scholarship and teaching from the moment they enter the Graduate Center, this year-long sequence of two three-credit courses introduces a variety of digital tools and digital methods through lectures offered by high-profile scholars and technologists, hands-on workshops, and collaborative projects. Students enrolled in the two-course sequence will complete their first year at the GC having been introduced to a broad range of ways to critically evaluate and to incorporate digital technologies into their academic research and teaching. In addition, they will have explored a particular area of digital scholarship and/or pedagogy of interest to them, produced a digital project in collaboration with fellow students, and established a digital portfolio that can be used to display their work. The two connected three-credit courses will be offered during the Fall and Spring semesters as MALS classes for master’s students and Interdisciplinary Studies courses for doctoral students.

During the Fall 2014 semester, students explored the landscape of the digital humanities, exploring a range of ways of approaching DH work and coming up with potential projects to create. In the spring, we will put those project proposals into action by taking, as our goal, the production of a small number of those projects by the end of the semester. In this praxis-oriented course, we will split up into teams and create, by the end of the semester, full-scale DH projects that we will launch by the end of the term. Students will end the class having gained hands-on experience in the planning, production, and dissemination of a digital humanities project and having picked up a variety of skills along the way.

The class will hold a public event at the end of the semester to launch its set of projects in a public venue. We aim to produce not student projects (in the sense of projects produced only for the purposes of a course), but rather projects that have a trajectory and timeline of their own that extends out beyond the range of the course itself. The Spring term is inspired by the work of the Praxis Program at the University of Virginia and made possible by support from the Graduate Center Provost’s Office and the GC Digital Fellows Program.

## Learning Objectives
Students will...
• gain hands-on experience in the planning, production, and dissemination of a digital humanities project
• work collaboratively in teams to produce all aspects of their chosen project. 
• take on specific roles within their teams in accordance with their strengths and desires for learning. • Students will document their progress through personal and team-based lab journals and public blogging on our course site.
• learn how to pick up new skills on their own during the course of the semester. 

## Requirements and Structure
Weekly Class Sessions: This is a praxis-based course, so most of our class sessions will be devoted to team meetings, project work, and consultations with GC Digital Fellows. Weekly readings may be assigned based on class needs. Students are expected to be working every week on their projects and project plans. 

## Progress Reports and Social Media Presence
Each team must produce at least one process-oriented project report each week, to be posted publicly on our shared course blog and tagged with a project-specific tag. Reports should catalogue project activities, discuss progress made, explore tricky problems, reach out to the general public with questions, and cultiveate interest in the project.

Each team should create a social media presence for their projects and use such accounts to share information and build an audience for the project. 

## Individual Lab Journals
Each student must keep an individual journal that should be used to catalogue weekly activities and progress, explore sticky questions, share personal reflections, and work through problems. Journals can be posted publicly to the course blog or kept privately. They should be shared with both instructors every week and are due by 9am on Monday morning. 

## Project Requirements
• Projects should relate to the digital humanities as explored through the Fall semester
• Project plans should include all aspects of the project life cycle, from development to deployment to testing to launch to sustainability.
• Projects must be public and project code must be open source and accessible online
• All code must logically organized and clearly documented
• A prototype of the project must be realized by the end of the semester
• Projects will be launched publicly at the final class of the year

## Project Report
A final project report (15-20 pages) must be submitted by each team at the end of the semester.
