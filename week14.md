+ Evaluation dicussion: what should we convey to Matt about what should happen in the Praxis class next year? 

Some things we already know -- the first semester should include a hands on overview of both git for project management and ssh for connecting to servers, and a better rundown of "how the internet works" -- how a URL becomes a page in the browser. Is there more?

+ Course Evals (I have mine -- or can do May 12)

+ Final Papers
